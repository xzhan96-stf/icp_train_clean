# Training data cleaning with inductive conformal prediction
This repository contain code in the development stage and deployment stage for the manuscript entitled "Reliability-based cleaning of noisy training labels with inductive conformal prediction in multimodal biomedical data mining".

# Introduction
Collecting well-curated training data has posed a challenge for biomedical machine-learning applications. To address the hardship, a reliability-based training data cleaning protocol based on inductive conformal prediction has been proposed in this study. With a small portion of well-curated training data, this protocol leverages the reliability quantified by inductive conformal prediction to detect the wrongly labeled data and outliers in the large portion of noisy-labeled training data. The effectiveness of this protocol is validated on three multi-modal biomedical machine learning classification tasks: filtering drug-induced-liver-injury literature based on free-text title and abstract, predicting ICU admission of COVID-19 patients based on radiomics and electronic health records, subtyping breast cancer based on RNA-seq data. The protocol generally leads to significantly improved classification performances under different levels of labeling noises simulated by manual label permutation. The protocol can be applied to multi-modal biomedical machine learning classification tasks to better use the noisy training data without requiring large quantities of well-curated training data.
